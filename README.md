# Identifying Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia Stages Using Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNAD

Dementia, and its most common cause, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are becoming increasingly prevalent amongst the global population, and particularly in seniors. Therefore, the need for quick, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to stop its progression. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as one of the most common tools used to identify these ailments, however manual evaluation is time-consuming, and subject to human error. To address this, AI-based deep-learning models are actively explored in order to discover a path to automate and
accelerate diagnosis for patients.

In this project, we develop a model by leveraging a pre-trained ResNet18 convolutional neural network to detect and discern the four different stages of dementia using 2-D structural MRI brain scan slices. Our custom-built pipeline was implemented using PyTorch libraries and provides strong results, with adept functions for quick classification alongside them. These findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in medical image classification and further highlight the skill of deep-learning tools for this task.
